  - `copy_file <src> <dst>`: Copy a file from source to destination.
  - `remove_file <file>`: Remove a file.
  - `empty_file <file>`: Empty the contents of a file.

- **System Information:**
  - `ipconfig`: Get the local machine's IP address.
  - `pwd`: Show the current working directory.
  - `date`: Get the current date.
  - `time`: Get the current time.
  - `time-hours`: Get the current hour.
